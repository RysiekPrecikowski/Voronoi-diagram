## Voronoi diagram - comparison of construction methods

### Introduction
Objective is to divide the Euclidean plane (with set of N points) into N cells (every cell contains exactly one point Pn) in such a way that any random point in given cell is located closer to Pn than to the other N-1 points.

### Analyzed algorithms
* Fortune's algorithm (sweep-line approach)
* Bowyer-Watson algorithm (Voronoi diagram is dual to Delaunay triangulation for given set of points)
